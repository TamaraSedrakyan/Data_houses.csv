Scrapped house data for Yerevan, as of 04.2020, that are currently on sale.

It explores the direct relationships between house price and features such as sqm size, number of rooms, agency, district, building type, etc.
The project aims to analyze, clean the data and create a model that best fits the data and can predict the price of the flat. 
Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree models were used and Polynomial second degree regression was the best performing one.
